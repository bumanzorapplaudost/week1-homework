# Week 1 Homework for the Trainee Program at applaudo studios. 

The project is pretty much self-explainatory. The first part is to create a Task Manager using the `localStorage` in JavaScript. It should add, and validate the form when adding. 

It also has the ability to filter by status, search by name and order by creation date.

The second part is a bonus calculator, you should enter the years worked, the base salary and if the years are less than one you are required to enter a certain number of days.
